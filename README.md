## User Polls: Requirements:


  <p>1) Enter user polls with a username<p/>
  <p>2) Vote on polls with a username<p/>
  <p>3) Browse rankings for polls<p/>
  <p>4) Focus on the Front-End and Design.
  For storage of users polls, poll instances and users I recommend you use a model/store which can be persisted to the browser (persistence for browser session only) or a backend<p/>

## Conclusion:

<p>The given solution above meets all the requirements above including the bonus back-end requirements.<p/>

<p>Due to the fact I had to get familiar with Html, CSS, Vue, and vuetify to complete the assignment in the limited time, I prioritized an MVP and then fulfilled the   back-end requirements.<p/>

<p>I am aware of the ineffectiveness of repeat codes.
Also, the final result of the front-end design is not to my design standard.
Considering the fact that a lot of time went into getting familiar with the technology, I am proud of the final result.<p/>
